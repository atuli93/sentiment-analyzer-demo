# Sentiment Analyzer Demo

![Sentiment Analyzer](Images/project1.png)

## Overview
Hi, I'm Atul ðŸ‘‹, a BCA student passionate about **AI & ML**, **Data Science**, and **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking**.  

This project is a **Sentiment Analyzer**, a web-based demo that predicts the sentiment of a text input as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** using machine learning techniques.  

It demonstrates my ability to:
- Build AI/ML applications from scratch.
- Deploy interactive web apps using **Streamlit**.
- Integrate real-world projects into a portfolio-ready format.

---

## Features
- **Interactive Input:** Enter any text and get an instant sentiment prediction.
- **Live Demo:** Accessible online, no installation required.
- **Open Source Code:** Explore the ML model, preprocessing, and web integration.
